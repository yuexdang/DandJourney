# About DandJourney

DandJourney is a proxy robot that encapsulates and extends Midjourney. It is primarily used to forward user demands to Midjourney (located on the Discord platform). With the proxy of the robot, multiple people can use one member account. Yes, there is no way to bypass Midjourney's membership mechanism.

- More platform support
- More custom features
- More expansion space.

### Why not usestable-diffusion

Although stable-diffusion is free, its neural network training is very resource-intensive, which can impact the overall output quality and efficiency due to its effect on computer performance and database. Until a better algorithm is developed, using MidJourney for now is also a good choice.

### Project progress

In the absence of a better platform, this project will continue to be updated.

Project is**open source**,and we all hope to work together to create a Bot that is convenient for everyday use. If non-project members use this project for **profit** or use it as a gimmick for **promotion**, my review is not favorable.

# Project iteration

Maybe you came here from [MidJourney-Wrapper（YuexdangRefactored](https://github.com/yuexdang/MidJourney-Wrapper). I would like to clarify the relationship between these two projects again.

This refactoring is quite different from the original author's code. It was built using the `discord-py-interactions` framework and the crawler part was also modified. The overall code has been decoupled and we plan to extract the API later. So I don't want to call it a refactoring version or an inherited version anymore, but a new project started from scratch.

Once again, I would like to thank the original author[Wildric-Auric](https://github.com/Wildric-Auric)and the version I first encountered,[MidJourney-Wrapper](https://github.com/Wildric-Auric/MidJourney-Wrapper).The original idea was of great help to me.
